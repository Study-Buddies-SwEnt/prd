# Business Model

*Expected operating Costs*

But we will also have some costs for the hosting of the app and the expenses related to the external services we are using to make our app work.
- Database operation, storage of data
- Video call API
- Google Maps API
- Salary : Developers, Designers, Marketing, Sales, Customer Support
- Marketing : Ads, Social Media, flyers, ...

*Revenue Streams*
In order to generate revenue, we are planning to have a freemium model, where the app is free to use but some features are locked and can be unlocked by paying a subscription fee.
We will have a free version, in order to attract users and make them discover our app, but we will also have a premium version, with more features and less limitations.

We could also think of other revenue streams, like displaying ads in the app for the non premium version.

Some possible upgraded version :
- Locked features such as flashcards, events in a group, schedule of study sessions could demand an 
- Add more people in a group
- More video call participants
- More storage for resources
- More customization options
