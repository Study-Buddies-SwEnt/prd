# Analysis of the Situation

*What are the competing products in the market today?*

*What are the complementary products in the market today?*

Actually there exists some products that offers similar features as our app, but none of them offers all the features inside only one app. For example, Discord is a platform that allows users to create servers and channels to chat, share resources, and make video calls. However, Discord is not focused on studying and doesn't offer features like a calendar, to-do lists, timers, and a map to see where friends are located.

The exists multiples products that offers competing features to our app as :
- Discord, a platform that allows users to create servers and channels to chat, share resources, and make video calls.
- Quizlet, permit to create flashcards to study and share them with friends
- Telegram, a messaging app that allows users to create groups and channels to chat and share resources

However none of them offers all the features inside only one app, so we think that our app could be a good alternative for students who want to study together and keep track of their work without having to use multiple apps.

Concerning the complementary products, we can think of :
- Google Calendar, to keep track of events, deadlines, and to-dos
- Youtube, to watch videos and tutorials
- Spotify, to listen to music while studying
- Moodle, to access course materials and exercises
- Onenote, to take notes and organize them

Our app could be complementary to these products, as it offers a centralized place where students can share resources, chat, make video calls, keep track of their work, and study together. And we could also think of integrating some of these products inside our app, like Google Calendar, Youtube, or Spotify, to offer a more complete experience to our users.
