# Business Model

*Expected operating Costs*

We are expecting some expenses for the development of new features, the maintenance of the app (external services and hosting) and the marketing in order to promote our app. Some examples are listed below :
- Database operation, storage of data
- Video call API
- Google Maps API
- Salary : Developers, Designers, Marketing, Sales, Customer Support
- Marketing : Ads, Social Media, flyers, ...

*Revenue Streams*
In order to generate revenue, we are planning to have a freemium model, where the app is free to use but some features are locked and can be unlocked by paying a subscription fee.
The free version will be used to attract users and make them discover our app and the premium version will offer more features and less limitations.

We could also think of other revenue streams, like displaying ads in the non-premium version of the app.

Some possible upgrades for the premium version :
- New features such as flashcards, ability to organize events in a group and schedule study sessions 
- Add more people in a group (limit at 10 for the free version)
- More video call participants (limit at 10 for the free version)
- More storage for resources 
- More customization options (widgets, color themes, profile personalization)
