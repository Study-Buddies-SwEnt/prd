# Analysis of the Situation

There exists multiple products that offer competing features to our app, such as :
- Discord, a platform that allows users to create servers and channels to chat, share resources, and make video calls.
- Quizlet, to create flashcards and share them with friends.
- Telegram, a messaging app that allows users to create groups and channels to chat and share resources.
- Whatsapp, another messaging app that allows users to create groups, chat and make calls.

However, our "all-in-one" app offers a much broader list of features and combines all the good of the apps mentionned above. That's why we believe that Study Buddies can be a good alternative for students who want to study together and keep track of their work without having to switch between multiple apps.

Concerning the complementary products, we can think of :
- Google Calendar, to keep track of events, deadlines, and to-dos
- Youtube, to watch videos and tutorials
- Spotify, to listen to music while studying
- Moodle, to access course materials and exercises
- Onenote, to take notes and organize them

Our app could be complementary to these products, as it offers a centralized place where students can share resources, chat, make video calls, keep track of their work and study together. It would be interesting to integrate or link to the mentionned complementary services to offer a more complete experience to our users.
