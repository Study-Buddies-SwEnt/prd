# Analysis of the Situation

There exists multiple of products that offer competing features to our app, such as :
- Discord, as mentionned earlier, a platform that allows users to create servers and channels to chat, share resources, and make video calls.
- Quizlet, allows to create flashcards to study and share them with friends
- Telegram, a messaging app that allows users to create groups and channels to chat and share resources
- Whatsapp, another messaging app that allows to create groups, chat and make calls

However, our "all-in-one" app offers a much broader list of features and combines all the good of the apps mentionned above. That's why we thing Study Buddies could be a good alternative for students who want to study together and keep track of their work without having to switch between multiple apps.

Concerning the complementary products, we can think of :
- Google Calendar, to keep track of events, deadlines, and to-dos
- Youtube, to watch videos and tutorials
- Spotify, to listen to music while studying
- Moodle, to access course materials and exercises
- Onenote, to take notes and organize them

Our app could be complementary to these products, as it offers a centralized place where students can share resources, chat, make video calls, keep track of their work and study together. It would be interesing to integrate or link the mentionned complementary services to offer a more complete experience to our users.
