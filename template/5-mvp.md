# The MVP

The Study Buddies MVP aims to fulfill most, if not all, of the features mentionned to promote the value proposition given above. In the sections below, we've gathered some of the key personas, user stories and features that makes our app viable in the long-term run of the project. 

## Personas and Scenarios

The main users, as expected, will be students all across the world. Be it university students or high schoolers. We aim to have an MVP that can be tailored to all age groups. Here are some user stories we have created :

- "As an international uni student, I want to be able to keep contact with my friends in my home country while still keeping up with the tight schedule of my studies."
- "As a high school student, I want to be able to share resources in a centralized application where my friends can also contribute and share their resources."
- "As a uni student, I want to keep track of my homework and project deadlines, be able to write and follow daily goals and also better manage my time studying through timers to avoid burnouts."

## Key Features

The key features of the MVP consist of those listed below : 

1. **Groups** : Allows to reunite your friends and share resources (images, links, pdfs, etc.) through different topics, includes a chat where members of the group can debate about questions and also an ability to put themselves as 'strong users' that have well understand a certain topic or exercise and are willing to help others.
2. **Video Call** : A single video call for each group, allowing members to work together even if they are far away from each other. Picture-in-picture allows seamless integration for the phone's other activities. 
3. **Calendar** : Personnalisable and linkable to Google Calendar, allows to easily keep track of deadlines and events through the year. Ability to upload the user's university academic calendar could be a nice addition.
4. **Map** : Allows to easily find your friends if you decided to meet up in person, can be toggled off anytime. 
5. **Timers** : To improve time management, shared timer in groups so that everyone has the same periods of studying and breaks. 
6. **Chats** : Different chats present throughout the app, general group chat, topic chats and private chat between users.

## Success Criteria

**User Retention** : Amount of users reached in the months following the launch. Amount of users remaining after a trial period of a few months.
**User Satisfaction** : Use feedback surveys with small benefits to get user feedback and more information about the app satisfaction. 
**Database Flow** : Use the database flow of chats sent, video calls created etc to have a better idea of the most popular features and what needs to be improved. 

## Features Outside the Scope

**User profile cards** : Not very useful. There won't be any 'new encounters' in the groups since they are representations of friend groups, hence everyone already knows everyone. Could be a nice addition to see for example the common groups between the user and their friends for a later version of the MVP.
**Dating app** : The goal of the app isn't to meet new people. It is to improve and allow better collaboration between existing friend groups. 
**Ability to refer friends** : Not that important for the MVP but could be a good marketing scheme. Allow existing users to invite new users for a small benefit (such as ability to send emojis in video calls for example)
