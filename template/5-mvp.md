# The MVP

The Study Buddies MVP aims to fulfill most, if not all, of the features mentionned to promote the value proposition given above. In the sections below, we've gathered some of the key personas, user stories and features that makes our app viable in the long-term run of the project. 

## Personas and Scenarios

The main users, as expected, will be students all across the world. Be it university students or high schoolers. We aim to have an MVP that can be tailored to all age groups. Here are some user stories we have created :

- "As an international uni student, I want to be able to keep contact with my friends in my home country while still keeping up with the tight schedule of my studies."
- "As a high school student, I want to be able to share resources in a centralized application where my friends can also contribute and share their resources."
- "As a uni student, I want to keep track of my homework and project deadlines, be able to write and follow daily goals and also better manage my time studying through timers to avoid burnouts."

## Key Features

*Identify and prioritise the key features required.*

The key features of the MVP consist of those listed below : 

1. **Groups** : Allows to reunite your friends and share resources (images, links, pdfs, etc.) through different topics, includes a chat where members of the group can debate about questions and also an ability to put themselves as 'strong users' that have well understand a certain topic or exercise and are willing to help others.
2. **Video Call** : A single video call for each group, allowing members to work together even if they are far away from each other. Picture-in-picture allows seamless integration for the phone's other activities. 
3. **Calendar** : Personnalisable and linkable to Google Calendar, allows to easily keep track of deadlines and events through the year. Ability to upload the user's university academic calendar could be a nice addition.
4. **Timers** : 

*Justify the importance of each feature.*

- Groups to offer a centralized place where students of the same course can share resources and use the chat to ask questions
- Video Call to offer a more social side of studying
- Calendar to keep track of revisions, deadlines, etc
- Timers to improve work effectiveness

## Success Criteria

*How will you evaluate the success of the MVP?*

- Amount of users
- User retention after launch
- User flows to database for example

*Metrics include user penetration, quality / satisfaction.*

*If applicable, progress in discussions with ecosystem partners / investors / customers.*

## Features Outside the Scope

*The MVP must be viable and minimal.*

*Which features donâ€™t belong in it.*

*How should these be eventually integrated and in what sequence.*

- Not a dating/make friends app
