# Functional Requirements

The objective is to develop an all-in-one app that enhances studying through elaborate collaboration. Our goal is to integrate all useful functionalities in one place, making it easy to use. The app will include the following features:
 1. **Groups**: Users can create groups focused on different topics, these groups have a name and a profile picture that can be modified any time. Each group has a chat feature for discussions, resource sharing, and collaboration on specific subjects. Users can highlight their strengths within the group, allowing others to identify who is proficient in certain areas and know whom to ask for help.
 2. **Timers**: The app includes both solo and shared timers. Timers can improve work efficiency by establishing a good work rhythm, incorporating breaks, and resuming work promptly. The shared timer is designed for group use, ensuring all members take breaks and work simultaneously to avoid distractions. This enhances efficiency, focus, and time management. Both timers can be used independently for any desired purpose.
 3. **Video Calls**: When group members cannot be in the same place simultaneously, working alone at home can be demotivating and challenging. Video calls enable group members to work online together, improving focus and productivity.
 4. **Map**: The map feature allows users to easily locate group members to collaborate together. This option can be enabled or disabled at any time to control the visibility of one's location.
 5. **Private Chat**: Users can initiate private chats with anyone to discuss various matters. The chat feature supports sharing pictures, documents, and links. Additionally, users can search messages based on type and content.
 6. **Calendar**: The calendar helps users keep track of deadlines, events, and manage daily planners. Users can add events at any time, including a title, date, and description.
 7. **To-Do List**: Users can add tasks to track their progress easily. Each task can be unmarked or marked as "In Progress," or "Completed." These tasks can have a title and a description and a due date.
